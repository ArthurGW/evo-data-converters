## Evo

Evo is a unified platform for geoscience teams. It enables access, connection, computation, and management of subsurface
data. This empowers better decision-making, simplified collaboration, and accelerated innovation. Evo is built on open
APIs, allowing developers to build custom integrations and applications. Our open schemas, code examples, and SDK are
available for the community to use and extend. 

Evo is powered by Seequent, a Bentley organisation.

## Pre-requisites

* Python virtual environment with Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
* Git
* Deswik Suite

## Installation

To do.

## DUF

Deswik Unified File (DUF) is a proprietary file format from Deswik Mining Consultants Pty Ltd.

### Publish geoscience objects from a DUF file
[The `evo-data-converters-common` library](packages/common/README.md) can be used to sign in. After successfully signing
in, the user can select an organisation, an Evo hub, and a workspace.

Choose the DUF file you want to publish. Choose an EPSG code to use for the Coordinate Reference System. You can also
specify tags to add to the created geoscience objects.

Then call `convert_duf`, passing it the DUF file path, EPSG code, the workspace metadata or service manager widget, the
tags, and finally a path you want the published objects to appear under in your workspace.

**Note:** Some geometry types are not yet supported. A warning will be shown for each element that could not be
converted.

### Export objects to DUF

To do.
