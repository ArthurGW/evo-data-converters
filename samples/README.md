## Evo samples

The samples are structured by feature, then by language. For example, the `data-converters/python` folder contains Python
examples for using the Data Converters library.

### Seequent Evo APIs

Once you have obtained an Evo access token and found your organisation ID and Evo hub URL, you can start to explore
the example data converters Jupyter notebooks.

### Setting up and running Jupyter notebooks

Notebooks can be run in your tool of choice (e.g. VS Code). To use Jupyter (the default):

```
uv sync --all-extras
```

Then in the directory of the notebook(s) you want to run, type:

```
jupyter notebook
```

It should open a browser where you can open the notebooks for the current directory.
